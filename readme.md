# PINN Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains a minimal implementation of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks** (PINNs) in PyTorch. PINNs combine neural networks with physics-based constraints, making them particularly useful for solving problems described by ordinary/partial differential equations.
